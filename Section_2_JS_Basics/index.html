<h1>Hello</h1>
We can add JavaScript (JS) code anywhere within the head tags or within the body tags.</br>
In 99% of the cases, it is advisable to insert the js line of code within the BODY tags, just at the bottom of the body tag.</br>
It is even more advisable, when you have several lines of JS, to externalize that Js in a separated file and link to that external file from the html page.</br>
This is similar to when using CSS code inside the html OR in an external CSS file.
Inserting your lines of JS within the HEAD tag is technically feasible BUT it can cause problems (?) so it's not advised.

<!--
<script>
    alert('Hello, world');
</script>
-->

<!-- Externalising the JS code to an isolated file:-->
<script src="sandbox.js"></script>
